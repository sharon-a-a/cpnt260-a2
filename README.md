## Code Review 
### The Bug
#### The bug happened to be the navigation bar. The navigation bar and the header border were overlapping, the nav bar being under it. I tried to fix it by putting a margin on it, but that was a failed attempt even after trying the negative integers. Then I remembered that the margin doesn't have to be only 1 number, you can adjust all sides individually. I then began playing around with the different sizes and it finally worked to my liking. I definitely think that after this trial and error run, will have helped me memorize the fact that you can play around with the different lengths you can make the margin. I believe that it will be stuck in my brain that there is not only one way to do the margin. It is extremely useful in many ways.
